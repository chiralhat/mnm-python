# mnm-python
Python scripts used for molecular nanomagnet data analysis and simulation

##Data Analysis
[smmesr](./smmesr.py) and [utility](./utility.py) are modules that provide the functions I use
for data analysis, which are generally called using a script like [FitSMM](./Data Analysis/FitSMM.py)

##Simulation
Most of my simulations (in [mn12sim](mn12sim) and [cr7mnsim](cr7mnsim)) rely on [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/),
so before you can run them you'll need to install it.
